To Run the code 

Download the folder from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uBBlvi2s8Pc37UaW3Goi-S906VUV1OP7?usp=sharing

If you don't have mlrose, set up the conda environment using environment.yml

After this, simply run the scripts for the given problem

For the individual optimization problems run their files "four_peaks_opt.py", "one_max_opt.py", and "knapsackopt.py" 

I wouldn't reccomend running gridsearch, but the code is there if someone wants to review it.

For the neural network graphs run "neural_network_graph.py"

And for the randomized test/train tests of the neural networks run neural_network_opt.py
